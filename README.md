Text based rock, paper, scissors game.

This was created to teach middle school students during my summer at iDTech Camps some basics of programming in C++. It applies declaring and initializing variables, printing statements, user input, random number generation, conditional statements, and while loops.

The user plays against a computer in a game of rock, paper, scissors (best out of 3).
